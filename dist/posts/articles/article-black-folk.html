    <h1>Much Homework</h1><p></p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">I</span> see a cotton field, stretching out as far as I can see.</p>
<p>The sun, hot and bright, beating down on the land.</p>
<p>Lord stands over me, ready to make me suffer more.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t let it faze me</p>
<p>For I know that I will find strength in this work.</p>
<p>And soon enough, I will be free.</p>
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">My</span> positivity never fade,</p>
<p>For I know my future won&#39;t be made.</p>
<p>But I keep on going despite it all,</p>
<p>For I know I will eventually stand tall.</p>
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">No</span> matter what comes my way, </p>
<p>I stay strong and fight another day. </p>
<p>My dreams, alive and well, </p>
<p>And I know I will make it through this hell.</p>
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">And</span> far at the other side</p>
<p>The place, where it&#39;d never denied</p>
<p>My beloveds they await</p>
<p>For me who lost weight.</p>
<p>And we will sing, for the coming good and golden days.</p>
