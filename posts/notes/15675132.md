## 1. Introduction

 Define a ***closure*** of a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ as an induced set of vertexes of $G$, where the out-tended edges in $E$ start at some vertex in the *closure* of $G$ and end at some vertex in the *closure*, too. More formally, *closure* is defined as a set of vertexes $V'\subseteq V$, such that $\forall u\in V',s.t.\forall\left<u,v\right>\in E,v\in V'$.

 For the *Maximum Weight Closure of a Graph*, we define it as, with starting out endowing vertexes in $V'$ costs called $w_u$, the maximum value of $\sum\limits_{u\in V'}w_u$.

## 2. Construction of Algorithm

 Add a source $s$ and a sink $t$ to the original graph, endow the origin edges in $E$ with capacities that $+\infty$, and connect $s$ with points with positive costs with the points' costs as capacities on them while $t$ connects to those with negative costs with the minus points' costs as capacities on them, where $+\infty$ is defined as any number greater or equal to $\sum |w_i|$.

 More formally, as explained & illustrated:

$$
V_N=V\cup\{s,t\} \\
E_N=E\cup\left\{\left<s,v\right>\mid v\in V,w_v\geqslant0\right\}\cup\left\{\left<v,t\right>\mid v\in V,w_v<0\right\} \\
\begin{cases}
c(u,v)=+\infty,\left<u,v\right>\in E \\
\displaystyle
c(s,v)=w_v,w_v\geqslant0 \\
\displaystyle
c(v,t)=-w_v,w_v<0
\end{cases}
$$

 Which make it easy to understand the answer would be $\text{min-cut}(G_N=\{V_N,E_N\})$.
