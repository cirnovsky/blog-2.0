<span style="font-variant:small-caps">I</span> see a cotton field, stretching out as far as I can see.

The sun, hot and bright, beating down on the land.

Lord stands over me, ready to make me suffer more.

But I don't let it faze me

For I know that I will find strength in this work.

And soon enough, I will be free.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps">My</span> positivity never fade,

For I know my future won't be made.

But I keep on going despite it all,

For I know I will eventually stand tall.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps">No</span> matter what comes my way, 

I stay strong and fight another day. 

My dreams, alive and well, 

And I know I will make it through this hell.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps">And</span> far at the other side

The place, where it'd never denied

My beloveds they await

For me who lost weight.

And we will sing, for the coming good and golden days.
